# SDS [Software Deployment System]

This is a project made during one hackathon which aims to ease the process of
installing multiple packages on different system. It provides a terminal user
interface using ncurses to select your linux distribiution and packages that you want to
install.

Even if this is not a complete deployment solution, further improvements
like specifying packages that are not in the list, ability to clone your
dotfiles from git and et-cetera will be added in the future.
